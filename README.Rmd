### Overview 📑

The goal of `bbsTaiwan` is to streamline Taiwan Breeding Birds Survey (BBS) data retrieval and analysis. It will support data retrieval from GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. This work was supported by [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/) 2023-2024, with the main developer [Sunny Tseng](https://sunnytseng.ca/) and the mentor [Eunseop Kim](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/29/champions-program-mentors-2023/).

The first version of bbsTaiwan is using 2009 to 2016 GBIF data (version XXX) and we will updated once new dataset is published

-   General introduction of the functionalities

-   Case study with the package

### Installation 💻

You can install and load the development version of `bbsTaiwan` from Github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SunnyTseng/bbsTaiwan")
```

### Main functions ⛺

`bbsTaiwan` provides several intuitive imported datasets and data processing functions. For accessing the raw Taiwan BBS dataset on GBIF:

-   `occurrence`: times and locations at which particular species have been recorded

-   `event`: the protocols used, the sample size, and the location for each

-   `measurementorfacts`: additional information relating to the events

-   `extendedmeasurementorfact`: additional information relating to the taxon occurrences

To perform basic data retrieval and visualization:

-   `bbs_translate()` translate bird species' Chinese common name to scientific name

-   `bbs_fetch()` fetch the cleaned version of Taiwan BBS cccurrence data by species

-   `bbs_plotmap()` visualize species distribution across all BBS sites

-   `bbs_history()` examine the number of BBS sites surveyed each year

-   `bbs_sites()` return the coordinates of sll BBS sites

### Usage 💡

```{r}
library(bbsTaiwan)

## Get data for species of interest
bbs_fetch(c("白頭翁", "烏頭翁"))

## Find the distribution/overlap of two species
bbs_plotmap(c("白頭翁", "烏頭翁"))
```
