## Overview üìë

The goal of `bbsTaiwan` is to streamline the retrieval and analysis of Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. This package facilitates data access from GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. While the data is openly available on GBIF, its complex arrangement in the Darwin Core format can make it challenging to understand and use, often requiring advanced data wrangling skills. The `bbsTaiwan` package is designed to simplify this process, making it easier to access and utilize Taiwan BBS data.

This project was supported by the [rOpenSci Champions Program](https://ropensci.org/champions/) 2023-2024, with [Sunny Tseng](https://sunnytseng.ca/) as the main developer and [Eunseop Kim](https://ropensci.org/blog/2023/11/29/champions-program-mentors-2023/) as the mentor. [Jerome Ko](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XbUxScIAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW) kindly assisted in interpreting and accessing the Taiwan BBS data.

## Version üîñ

**v1.0.0 (Initial Release):** Developed based on the GBIF Taiwan BBS dataset v1.9, which covers data from 2009 to 2016.

## Installation üíª

You can install and load the development version of `bbsTaiwan` from Github with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SunnyTseng/bbsTaiwan")
```

## Main functions ‚õ∫

`bbsTaiwan` provides several intuitive imported datasets and data processing functions. To perform basic data retrieval and visualization:

-   `bbs_history()` examine the number of BBS sites surveyed each year

-   `bbs_sites()` return the coordinates of all BBS sites

-   `bbs_fetch()` fetch the cleaned version of Taiwan BBS cccurrence data by species

-   `bbs_plotmap()` visualize species distribution across all BBS sites

-   `bbs_translate()` translate bird species' Chinese common name to scientific name

For accessing the raw Taiwan BBS dataset on GBIF:

-   `occurrence`: times and locations at which particular species have been recorded

-   `event`: the protocols used, the sample size, and the location for each

-   `measurementorfacts`: additional information relating to the events

-   `extendedmeasurementorfact`: additional information relating to the taxon occurrences

## Usage üí°

```{r example}
library(bbsTaiwan)

## Get data for species of interest
bbs_fetch(c("ÁôΩÈ†≠ÁøÅ", "ÁÉèÈ†≠ÁøÅ"))

## Find the distribution/overlap of two species
bbs_plotmap(c("ÁôΩÈ†≠ÁøÅ", "ÁÉèÈ†≠ÁøÅ"))
```
