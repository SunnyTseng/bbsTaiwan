Description: The goal of bbsTaiwan is to streamline the retrieval and analysis of 
  Taiwan Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data. This package facilitates data access from 
  GBIF, where Taiwan BBS data are stored. While the data is openly available on GBIF, 
  its complex arrangement in the Darwin Core format can make it challenging to 
  understand and use, often requiring advanced data wrangling skills. The bbsTaiwan 
  package is designed to simplify this process, making it easier to access and utilize 
  Taiwan BBS data.
